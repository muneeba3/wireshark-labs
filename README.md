# 🧪 Wireshark Networking Labs

Welcome to my **Wireshark Networking Labs** repository!  
This repo contains hands-on network analysis exercises I performed using **Wireshark**.  
The goal is to demonstrate practical knowledge of **network protocols, cybersecurity basics, and packet analysis** — key skills for a Cyber Security Analyst / ICT Security Specialist role.

### 🔹 [Lab 2 – TCP 3-Way Handshake](Lab2-TCP3-Way-Handshake/README.md)
- Captured the **SYN → SYN/ACK → ACK** handshake when connecting to Google.
- Understood how TCP establishes reliable connections.
- Learned to use Wireshark filters to isolate handshake packets.
